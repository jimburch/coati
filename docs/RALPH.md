# Ralph — Autonomous AI Worker System

## Overview

Ralph is an autonomous dispatcher/worker system that processes GitHub Issues using Claude Code agents running in GitHub Actions. It follows Matt Pocock's dispatcher/worker architecture from his [course-video-manager](https://github.com/mattpocock/course-video-manager) project.

**Flow:** You create issues (manually or via Claude Code skills during work sessions) → label them `ralph` → run `pnpm dispatch` → dispatcher (Sonnet) reads issues, builds dependency graph, orders by priority → dispatches a single GitHub Actions workflow → worker (Opus) processes tasks sequentially on a `ralph` branch → each task is committed, pushed, and the issue closed → after all tasks complete, `ralph` merges into `develop` → you review `develop` and merge into `main`.

```

## Git Flow

```
main (production, deploys)
  ↑ merge (manual, after review)
develop (long-lived integration branch, repo default)
  ↑ merge (automatic, after all tasks complete)
ralph (ephemeral, created fresh from develop per dispatch)
```

- **`main`** — Production branch. Deploys happen from here.
- **`develop`** — Long-lived integration branch. All new work (Ralph and human) lands here. Set as the repo default branch.
- **`ralph`** — Ephemeral branch created fresh from `develop` at the start of each dispatch. Deleted after merging into `develop`.

| Acceptance criteria tracking   | Worker checks off `- [ ]` → `- [x]` in issue body incrementally as it works |

| Retry strategy                | Up to 3 attempts per task, 10min timeout each. Retry prompt includes gate errors + git diff |
| Failure policy                | Rollback changes, comment on issue, swap AFK→HITL label, continue to next task |

## Labels

- `ralph` — Issue is ready for Ralph to pick up
- `priority:high` — High priority (red)
- `priority:medium` — Medium priority (yellow)
- `priority:low` — Low priority (green)
- `AFK` — Can be implemented autonomously (blue)
- `HITL` — Requires human-in-the-loop (yellow)

## History

### v1 — Parallel branches with PRs (2026-03-22)

Original architecture: dispatcher selected parallel tasks, each worker created a `claude/*` branch, opened a PR, user reviewed and merged.

**Test runs:**
- Issue #2 (star button bug): First run failed due to repo permissions. Second run succeeded — worker completed in ~6 minutes, PR #3 merged.

### v2 — Sequential processing on ralph branch (2026-03-23)

Simplified to sequential processing: single `ralph` branch from `develop`, worker loops through tasks one at a time, auto-merges into `develop` when done. Removed PR creation — worker commits directly and closes issues.

**Motivation:** Remove PR review overhead per ticket, allow Ralph to chain through dependency graphs in one dispatch, preserve safety via `develop` → `main` merge gate.

### v3 — Retry loop with external verification (2026-03-23)

Added iteration loop per task (max 3 attempts, 10min each) inspired by Matt Pocock's `afk-ralph.sh`. Script now runs quality gates externally after each Claude invocation to verify success. Failed commits are reset (`git reset HEAD~1`). Retry prompts include gate errors + git diff context. Tasks that exhaust all attempts get rolled back, commented with failure details, and relabeled AFK→HITL. Workflow timeout bumped to 60 minutes.

## Known Issues & Things to Figure Out

### 1. Worker prompt may need iteration

The worker prompt is a living document. After reviewing actual output from real runs, we'll likely need to tune:

- How much exploration vs. implementation time the worker spends
- Whether the quality gate instructions are clear enough
- Whether the retry prompt gives enough context for successful recovery

### 2. E2E tests not in quality gates

Unit tests run before commit, but Playwright E2E tests are skipped because they need a running app + database. Options to explore:

- Add a `pnpm build` step to the worker quality gate (catches more issues)
- Set up a test database in CI for E2E (adds complexity)
- Keep E2E as a manual check during `develop` → `main` review (current approach)

### 3. Cost monitoring

No cost tracking or budget caps beyond timeouts. Each attempt is capped at 10 minutes, each task at 3 attempts, and the workflow at 60 minutes total. Consider:

- Tracking spend per issue/dispatch
- Setting up alerts for runaway workers

### 4. Stale branch cleanup

If a workflow fails mid-run, the `ralph` branch may be left behind. No automated cleanup exists.

### 5. Input validation for websiteUrl

Separate from Ralph, but noted: the profile page crashes on invalid `websiteUrl` values. Input validation at the save layer is needed (tracked separately from the try/catch fix).
